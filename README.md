# Zown

(Z)one (own)ership is designed to be a world management system that allows server administrators to subdivide their worlds into functional areas that can behave differently from other divisions. This ability can be extended and controlled from the administrator level down to the player level allowing players to create and manage their own protected areas based on the permissions provided by the server administrator. It has been designed to also serve as a foundational tool that other plugins could build off of for more specialized needs such as towns, specialized flags, adventure maps, or anything requiring specialized handling of player access to interact or build.

Zown also includes an optional template system to help organize and manage the individual zowns. Templates allow administrators to create as many default configurations as they like for their subdivisions and then apply them to new zowns for instant setup. A template providing default claim permissions for player created zowns is a good example of how they might be used. The administrator can predefine a starting setup for players along with restrictions for modifications the player can make to those zowns. 

Through the template system, an administrator can push configuration changes to all associated zowns belonging to a template with one modification. A zown with an assigned template can also later be over-ridden if you decide you want a particular zown to differ slightly from the template.
